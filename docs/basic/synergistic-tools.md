## [Better Fountain - VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=piersdeseilligny.betterfountain)

> *Fountain autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and export to PDF*

- **Fountain screenplay writing in VS Code!**
- It's what I've been using before this, and what I will continue to use for its:
    1. Export to PDF
    2. Actual PDF-like Live Preview
    3. Familiarity with my coding workflows and configurations
    4. Screenplay statistics (afterwriting-labs integration)
    5. Repository management, like version control with `git`
    6. Writing Fountain directly
- The BetterFountain plugin and IDE editor are both still great UX that I will still use.
- That said,
    1. I want links to integrate with my Obsidian vault.
    2. Since Fountain is meant to be written in one long document, it gets bulky. Which leads us to...

## [kevboh/longform](https://github.com/kevboh/longform)

> *A plugin for Obsidian that helps you write and edit novels, screenplays, and other long projects.*

- **Manage and compile notes into an ordered manuscript!**
- Yes! This means you can write Fountain in separate files! And sequence them!
- Through longform's [Compile](https://github.com/kevboh/longform/blob/main/docs/COMPILE.md) feature, you can strip markdown items like frontmatter, comments and wikilinks from source files!
- Then you can specify an output file as `out/$1.fountain`!
- **ESSENTIAL** tool if you're really going to use Obsidian for any writing projects.

## [MeepTech/obsidian-custom-file-extensions-plugin](https://github.com/MeepTech/obsidian-custom-file-extensions-plugin)

> *An obsidian plugin allowing you to register and view different file extensions in a modular manner.*

- Allows you to open `.fountain` files in the Obsidian editor!
- Fountain syntax formatting works!
- But `.fountain` files will not be linked in the editor... we'll see about this.
