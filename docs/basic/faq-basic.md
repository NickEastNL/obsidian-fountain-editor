Markdown is what I'm using to write what you're seeing. For example, to **bold words**, you wrap text in double-asterisks `**like this**`. There's a "Source" Mode where you see all the ugly prefix/inline-symbols, but there's a "Preview" rendered mode where all the formatting/styling gets applied according to the symbols that you used.

- **FREE**: Pay nothing.
- **Robust**: Used for websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.
- **Portable**: Open and edit with any program. Export and import seamlessly.
- **Platform-independent**: Any device with any OS.
- **Future-proof**: Open, non-proprietary file formats; no vendor lock-in. Preserved for forever.

Obsidian is an app to manage a vault (folder) of many markdown files. The app provides tools for you to churn out **beautiful, semantically-structured text**. Links, Tags and community tools help you **easily connect complex files/ideas into a web of information** in digital format — like a "second brain".

I've used Obsidian for academic note-taking, reflective daily journaling, task/project planning, blog writing, exploring/synthesizing ideas, and now story-planning/writing.

- **FREE**: Pay nothing.
- **Markdown**: All the perks aforementioned above.
- **Local Files**: Just regular files, stored in a folder, on your device.
  - **Privacy**: No data gets sent to anyone's cloud servers, so never worry about leaks.
  - **Speed**: Local access is magnitudes faster than cloud access. SPEED is why I searched for a Notion alternative.
  - **Accessibility**: Offline-first access.
- **Customizable**: 1000+ community plugins & themes for every workflow & style — or develop your own, like I'm doing!

Fountain is an amazing markup syntax that **strips away all the complexities** of formatting/styling, so that you can **focus on what matters most: content**. The syntax covers everything you really need. I never want to write in any other way.

- **FREE**: Pay nothing.
- **Markdown**: All the perks aforementioned above.
  - **Plain-text**: Functional, even without the styling!
  - **Portable**: Archive it forever. Share it easily. Use plenty of compatible apps.
  - **Version-controllable**: Something I've never really seen done before, where you can use tools like Git to track the history of edits, or even create alternate-timeline git-branches of changes!
