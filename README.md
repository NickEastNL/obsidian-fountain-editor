## Usage

### Quickstart

Currently in beta, you may use [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) to install it!

Open any file and add `cssclasses: fountain` to the frontmatter metadata Properties. You will get automatic formatting according to the [Fountain syntax rules](https://fountain.io/syntax/)!

```yaml
---
cssclasses:
  - fountain

### Disclaimer

This plugin should only extend your view and should never modify any local files, but to be safe, just play around in test vaults until we reach a stable 1.0.0!

## Design Guidelines

### Interoperable

Obsidian-flavored Markdown plays quite well with Fountain syntax, generally. We need to define some rules for those overlapping areas. You can read more at [Conflicts between Obsidian-flavored Markdown vs Fountain](<docs/basic/Conflicts between Obsidian-flavored Markdown vs Fountain.md>).

For this particular project, these are the general design philosophies:

1. ‚úÖ **Fountain-compliant**: If a markdown document is written in Fountain syntax, the entire document (syntax) must be ***100% compatible with Fountain*** processors and exporters. (If you want local Fountain syntax, just use a codeblock!)
  1a. ‚öñÔ∏è **Formatting Parity**: The entire final processed document, especially the actual Fountain parts (that is, not the escaped synopsis or boneyard sections), should look ***as similar to the rendered Live Preview formatting*** as possible.
2. ü•á **Fountain-first**: A ***Fountain-first user***, who has no previous knowledge of Obsidian or Markdown, should be able to write a full Fountain document with zero friction.
3. ü•à **Obsidian-second**: An ***Obsidian-first user*** may be allowed to lose/forfeit their usual/familiar Obsidian syntax **IF** it conflicts with standard Fountain syntax.
  3a. ü™ì **Escape Hatches**: Since Fountain takes precedence, we should have Fountain-compliant methods to write sections of regular Markdown!

### Parallel

**Fountain-formatted notes should live in parallel with regular Obsidian Markdown notes.**

According to [Interoperable](#interoperable)#1 (Fountain-compliance), files will be either regular Obsidian markdown, or completely Fountain-compliant.

We should be able to mark/declare certain files to be Fountain-formatted, or to define some glob pattern for a group of files. Right now, you can enable Fountain formatting by marking a file with the frontmatter metadata Property `cssclasses: fountain`.

Then, Obsidian note-making is business as usual, until we come across a file that is marked for Fountain-formatting. That is the scope that this plugin will operate in.

(This one is subject to change! See [this discussion](https://github.com/chuangcaleb/obsidian-fountain-live/discussions/4) for a possible alternative)

### Scoped

This plugin should do [one thing well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy). That one thing is to add Live Editor styling for the Fountain syntax to Obsidian.

That said, there are a LOT of tools that can fill obvious missing steps in your pipeline.

#### Recommended Tools

- [Better Fountain - Visual Studio Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=piersdeseilligny.betterfountain): *Fountain autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and export to PDF*
  - **Fountain writing in VS Code!**
  - It's what I've been using before this, what I will continue to use for its:
    1. Export to PDF!
    2. Live Preview!
    3. Screenplay statistics!
    4. Repository management, like handling `git`. Obsidian will still use `git`.
    5. Writing Fountain directly. It's still a great UX that I will still use.
  - That said,
    1. I want links to integrate with my Obsidian vault.
    2. Since Fountain is meant to be written in one long document, it gets bulky. Which leads us to...
- [kevboh/longform](https://github.com/kevboh/longform): *A plugin for Obsidian that helps you write and edit novels, screenplays, and other long projects.*
  - **Manage and compile notes into an ordered manuscript!**
  - Yes! This means you can write Fountain in separate files! And sequence them!
- [MeepTech/obsidian-custom-file-extensions-plugin](https://github.com/MeepTech/obsidian-custom-file-extensions-plugin): *An obsidian plugin allowing you to register and view different file extensions in a modular manner.*
  - Allows you to open `.fountain` files in the Obsidian editor!
  - Fountain syntax formatting works!
  - But `.fountain` files will not be linked in the editor.
